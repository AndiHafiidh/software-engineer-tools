[Asana](https://asana.com/product) is web based software-as-a-service designed to improve team collaboration. It focuses on allowing users to manage projects and tasks online without the use of email.

Each team can create a workspace. Workspaces contain projects, and projects contain tasks. In each task, users can add notes, comments, attachments, and tags. Users can follow projects and tasks and, when the state of a project or task changes, followers get updates about the changes in their inboxes.

# Pros
Asana allows its users to visualize their goals, track their time, assign priority to their tasks, and get updates on the project right in the program. It also has a calendar function to graph the team’s tasks right onto the dashboard.

In addition, over the past year, it’s added an **Android app**, the ability to convert a task to a project, conversations, and dashboards. It’s been beefing up–last year, its biggest con was that it didn’t have enough features.
# Cons
Asana does not allow offline use. In addition, reviewers feel that *“sometimes it is not intuitive enough to find something.”*

# Overall review
Asana is a new take at tracking work, it's android app, the ability to visualize goals, and the ability to create a workspace makes projects easier than before. However it's inability to allow offline use is a major draw back in its general usability for users that aren't always connected to the internet.
