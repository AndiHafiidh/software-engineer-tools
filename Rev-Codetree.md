###The key differences between Codetree and GitHub Project

 Task         | Codetree      | GitHub Projects
 ------------ | ------------- | ------------
Multiple Repo Support | Shows all your issues from multiple repos in one view | Shows subset of issues from single repo
Defining your Kanban Workflow | Smart default. Just need to do it once | No default. Need to do it for every board you create
Adding issues to a board | All issues added automatically | Need to add every issue manually
Filtering your issues on a board | Filter by milestone, assignee, labels, creator, and more | No filtering
Combining filters | Combine as many filters as you want, e.g. "Show me issues assigned to Joe for the Oct milestone with the ‘UX’ label" | No filtering
Save shortcuts to filtered boards | As many as you want - your filtered boards are a click away after you save the shortcut | No filtering or shortcuts
